    "## Running the Service\n",
    "Prerequisites: You should have all dependencies (Flask) installed. This step is already done if you ran \"pip install -r requirements.txt\". You also need to have the database built and a Mongo instance running locally on port 27017. Steps to do all of this can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rguo123/m2g-lims/blob/master/docs/Dataset_Registration.ipynb).\n",

    "#### 2. Go to http://localhost:5000/\n",
    "#### 3. Click on stuff!\n",

    "**Note**: The status column you see on the index page is just a proof-of-concept for something we want to implement in the future. If there are missing derivatives or errors in a dataset, we would like to specify that. Since we aren't dealing with different pipelines and are just treating everything in m2g.io as absolute, we don't have a \"error\" field in the database yet."
